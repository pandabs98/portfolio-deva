                        Hi, I&apos;m Bhagyashwariya Panda, a passionate and detail-oriented Full Stack Developer with a relentless drive for solving problems and building efficient, modern web applications.

                        Coding isn&apos;t just my job — it&apos;s my core passion. I dedicate my time to improving my skills, understanding systems deeply, and creating powerful applications that serve real-world needs. Whether it&apos;s writing scalable backend logic, crafting seamless user interfaces, or debugging complex issues, I thrive in the process of turning ideas into working software.

                        I specialize in technologies like Next.js, React, Node.js, and MongoDB, and I&apos;m always pushing myself to explore better architectures, cleaner code, and smarter solutions. No distractions, no split focus — just one goal: to build and solve through code.
